            The coupleâ€™s first dance is usually the money
            dance. Guests circle around the bride and groom. The couple will
            dance around the circle while guests attach money to the newlyweds'
            clothes using tape or pins. The bride and groom will offer a drink
            in exchange. This Filipino tradition is a way for guests to wish
            good luck and fortune upon the newlyweds and is considered a way to
            help the newlyweds get started financially.
